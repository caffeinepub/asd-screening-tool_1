  "summary": "The diff implements a client-side single-page screening flow (Hero → Input → Questionnaire → Results) with a footer and basic M-CHAT-R scoring, plus styling/fonts and a hero image reference. However, some requirements cannot be confirmed from the diff (due to truncation/omitted files), and some requested assets/copy requirements are not evidenced. The diff also includes additional auth/actor/react-query plumbing and an empty backend actor that were not requested by the BuildRequest.",
